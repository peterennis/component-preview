## Card

Card components are a great way to display important pieces of content, and are quickly emerging as a core design pattern for apps. Cards can contain images, buttons, text and more. Cards can also be used standalone, in a list or in a grid.

```html
<ion-card>
  <ion-img src="/assets/myImg.png"></ion-img>

  <ion-card-content>
    <ion-card-title>Hello World</ion-card-title>

    <p>The content for this card</p>
  </ion-card-content>
</ion-card>
```
